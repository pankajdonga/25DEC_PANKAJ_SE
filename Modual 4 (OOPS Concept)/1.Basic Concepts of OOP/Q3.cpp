//Q.3 What is the difference between OOP and POP?

In OOP, programs are organized around objects and data rather than actions and logic. Here, data is hidden and cannot be accessed by external functions. 
In contrast, POP is organized around functions and procedures, focusing more on the actions that happen in the program.
